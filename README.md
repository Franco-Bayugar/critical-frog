The main of this project:
1) Work with the Python Framework, **Django**. 
2) Work with **APIView classes**:
  2.1) Both, **Function-based views** (FBV) and **Class-based views** (CBV)
3) Employ the **Django ORM** and **SQLite3** for database.
4) Work with the **terminal** in order to avoid as much as I can the interface. Making migrations; running the server; create posts with a local JSON file; push changes to this repo, etc.
5) Pulling an **orderly** and clean **workflow**.
